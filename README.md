# mc3ds-mods
Collection of mods for Minecraft: New Nintendo 3DS edition that I have made.

Each folder contains the romfs directory for the game, simply copy the romfs for whatever mod you want into your game's mod folder and boot the game.
# About my mods
Not all of these mods can be merged together! Some will overwrite the same files or break functionality with eachover. Please be careful when merging mods and if something breaks remove your romfs folder!

# Thanks to the MC3ds modding community including my good friends; Cracko, wyndchyme, Vance, STB and PizzaLeader.
