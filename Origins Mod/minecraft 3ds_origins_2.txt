The 2nd edition of my re-imagined origins mod for 3DS!

This small scale modpack includes 3 origins to pick from in the downloads section:

CURSED HUMAN:
You messed with powers beyond your control in search of power, now you have been cursed.

You are capped to level 20.

You walk slightly faster.

You have a lower default and max saturation.

You take slightly less fall damage

ELF:

An elf who exceeds with bows and foraging.

Red and Brown mushrooms can be eaten for 2 hunger points, at a faster rate than normal food (16 tick)

Your arrows deal more damage, travel further and have a larger hitbox.

You have a smaller stomach, this reduces your default and max saturation.

You are slightly faster.

You have smaller lungs, therefore you run out of beath underwater faster.

VAMPIRE:

You burn in sunlight

Undead mobs are passive towards you.

You can only eat red or meat based foods.

You can breath underwater for longer than normal.

You have additional health.

This mod replaces player.json, and depending on what origin you pick, all zombie/skeleton jsons and items.json as well.
