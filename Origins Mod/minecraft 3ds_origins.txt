This small scale modpack includes 3 origins to pick from in the downloads section:

MERMAID:

You can only travel on land for 1 minute before needing to submerge in water.

Enderman do not get angry at you unless you attack them.

You have better luck getting treasure from fishing.

ENDERMAN:

You are weak to water, contact with it causes physical pain.

By interacting with an Enderman using diamonds you can trade them for ender pearls.

You deal more damage.

You can throw enderpearls further than usual.

IRON GOLEM:

You are too heavy to swim and sink when in water.

You control like a tank (forwards& backwards using left stick, turn using right)
